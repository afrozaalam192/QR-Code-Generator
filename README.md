# QR-Code-Generator
It is a simple Node JS based QR Code Generator application.

I learned it under the guidance of Sachin Kapoor sir from Sharma Computer Academy.

## There are 6 libraries/modules I have used:

### 1. inquirer : 
        It is a npm library for taking input from the user and a lot of types to take input like list, checkbox, password, rowlist, confirm etc.

### 2. chalk : 
        It is also a npm library for coloring the output like if we want to change the terminal font color, font background color then it provides very easy way to do this.

### 3. validator : 
        It is also a npm library for validating strings only like URL, Email, etc.

### 4. qr-image : 
        It is alos a npm library for generating qr code.

### 5. fs : 
        It is a core module of Node JS. fs stands for file system. We use it for handling files like reading data, writing data, set permissions, etc.

### 6. path : 
        it is also a core module of Node JS. We use it for directory path, file path, etc.

If you want to use it then please download/clone it on your local system and open it any IDE like VSCode and open terminal and fire a command "node app.js" because app.js is a main module of this project
or
you can simply create a directory "QR-Code-Generator" and open it on the VSCode and initialize npm by using the command :npm init -y" via terminal and install all required libraries of npm by using the command npm install "lib_name" and create 4 more module that I have used.
